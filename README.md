todo: To Read the File into React page using Nodejs for the Server

## The App
![search-found](https://github.com/itIsJim/SiciliaMia/blob/bbce8c160bc3e47657188e36810a940b45c6f3e5/search-found.png)
  The app will allow the user to search for the 'Description', 'Link', and 'Category' of an API from the JSON file provided (server/ inText.txt), with the name of API typed in the search bar. The system will return the most relatable API (top of the list) to the dashboard at the header, and a list of suggestions with APIs sharing the same letter(s) will be in display as well. Should there be no matching results, there will not be the list nor the dashboard.

## How to develop

0. Install Node.js and reserve two local ports

     ```
     npm i node
     ```
      
1. The Server (Proxy: http://localhost:3001/) 

    ```
    cd server 
    npm start <- server on  
    ```  
    
2. The Client (Link: http://localhost:3000/) ðŸ‘ˆ
 
    ```
    cd client
    npm install
    npm start <- web app on ðŸš€
    ```
    
3. To Store Data in Mongodb

    ```
    cd server
    node connection.js
    ```
